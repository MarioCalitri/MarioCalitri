😄 About Me
Hi, I’m Mario — future Mobile App Developer™ currently training at Trios College.

🐶🔥🧱 When I'm pretending to code...
You can usually find me:

📺 Performing extensive “research” (translation: watching TV and movies)
🐶 Managing two American Bulldogs who believe they’re the real owners of the house
🧱 Buying, selling, and collecting LEGO — mostly pirate ships, because someone has to defend the living room
🔥 Running my Big Green Egg like a backyard Michelin chef (results may vary)


🧠 Life Philosophy

“If all else fails:
add more LEGO or more BBQ.”

😅 Final Notes
Feel free to explore my repos —
just please don’t judge my commit messages.
Yes, “fixed stuff” is a valid message.
And no, I will not apologize.<!--
