Future Mobile App Developer™ | Bulldog Peacekeeper | LEGO Pirate Admiral | Code Wrangler

I’m currently studying Mobile App Development at Trios College, where I spend my days learning how to convince code to behave and my nights Googling why it didn’t.

📱 What I’m Building (or Breaking)

Crafting mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS (on a good day)
Experimenting with UI/UX so my layouts stop looking like discount marketplace apps
Slowly mastering Git without accidentally deleting the universe
Expanding my debugging superpowers — currently at Level 2 (Level 3 unlocks patience)


🧱 Outside the Coding Mines
When I’m not battling a rogue semicolon, I'm probably:

🧱 Expanding my LEGO pirate fleet (the living room is now “The High Seas”)
🐶 Negotiating ceasefires between my two American Bulldogs
🔥 Pretending to be a Michelin chef on the Big Green Egg (BBQ/smoker)
📺 Doing very important “research” — mostly movies and TV shows


🧠 Philosophy I Code By
“If all else fails, stay calm and ask the All‑Seeing Eye (AI).”
It judges me less than my IDE.

💻 Tools I’m Learning to Tame

Git & GitHub (commit messages still chaotic but improving… maybe)
UX/UI - Figma
Co-pilot
and much much more to follow!
